            <p id="about-Summary">Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar (22 December 1887 - 26 April 1920) was an Indian
                mathematician. Often regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, though he had almost no
                formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number
                theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then
                considered unsolvable.</p>

                            Ramanujan was born into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar
                            family in Erode, in present-day Tamil Nadu.

                            Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school.

                            He passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the
                            best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School,
                            where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.

                            When he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of A Synopsis of Elementary
                            Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, G. S. Carr's collection of
                            5,000 theorems.

                            Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's
                            headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer.

                            Ramanujan ran away from home, heading towards Visakhapatnam, and stayed in Rajahmundry for
                            about a month. He later enrolled atPachaiyappa's College in Madras.

                            Ramanujan failed his Fellow of Arts exam and again a year later. Without an FA degree, he
                            left college and continued to pursueindependent research inmathematics, living in extreme
                            poverty and often on the brink of starvation.

                            founded the Indian Mathematical Society. Wishing for a job at the revenue department where
                            Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his mathematics notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "I was struck by the extraordinary mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had
                            no mind to smother his genius by an appointment in the lowest rungs of the revenue
                            department."

                            In his 17-page paper "Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers", Ramanujan gave three proofs,
                            two corollaries and three conjectures. His writing initially had many flaws. As Journal
                            editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "Mr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in
                            clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such
                            intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him."

                            Ramanujan wrote to G. H. Hardy, whom he knew from studying Orders of Infinity (1910).After
                            seeing Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions on the last page of the manuscripts,
                            Hardy said the theorems
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",
                            and that they "must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the
                            imagination to invent them".

                        <p>
                            Hardy asked a colleague, J. E. Littlewood, to take a look at the papers. Littlewood was
                            amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded
                            that the
                            letters were

                            "certainly the most remarkable I have received" and that Ramanujan was "a mathematician of
                            the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power"

                            been published the preceding year in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society.
